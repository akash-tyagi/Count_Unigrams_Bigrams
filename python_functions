Python Functions:
List: []
    They can grow and shrink in size
    
    List Comprehensions:
        [expr for var in list]
    
    
Tuple: ()
    They are of fixed size and constants
    
    So if you want the sort function to behave differently just let the key function to return tuple and if will sort on first value and then second value and we can dictate the behaviour of our sort function
    
Dict: {}
    d = {} 
    d['a'] will throw error
    d.get('a') will work here and return None

    d.keys() --- give keys in random order
    d.values() -- give all the keys
    d.items() -- print all the items(key, value)
 
File
    Reading: 
       for lie in f
       f.readlines() // read each line as list element
       f.read() // read the entire file as single string   
1.sorted : for sorting
    sorted(list)
    sorted(list, reverse= true)
    sorted(list, key = len/some function)
    
2. list functions
    pop
    add two lists: list1 + list 2
    
3. search some char or string/number in string or list
    "char/string" in string/list

4. Copy 
    list1 = list2[:] / string1 = string[:]

5. concatenate lists with join
    " ".join(list)
    
6. split a string into lists
    string.split(':')
    
7. range function to create lists easily: range(20)
